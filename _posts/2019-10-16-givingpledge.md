If you're reading this, chances are you're richer than 9 out of 10 people on this planet. Have you ever thought about how your life might be different if you were born in the developing world? As a straight white American male, this thought crosses my mind often (although probably not as often as it should). I often think about how *fortunate* I am to be so comparatively rich, mostly due to factors outside my control like where I was born and who my parents are. Often, this thought is accompanied by a pang of guilt.

And maybe there's good reason to feel guilty. Economists have studied the relationship between money and happiness, and found no relationship above annual incomes of between [$75,000](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489) and [$105,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=JBgmiRAoYQhtBgbj0zSVX9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6pRUGAIioLhu85ORBsjF_g5Rf0fuUViMASagr_M7VEy5MRXaYGPiRKa_FSO3qh3qFZW2eGnWNkmHVW7J5KJM5kHZ_dY8AULUrukyysIQ5PxXS7cUPJ28GwywaXRvjNOW4O4S4YopfDke1c2jLpKYweA_UiNmDU37muQ3AVIlWIl62D0tBToG48TSKGKsGp9KMPce9WhaRHaEaoEzqc98rna7AGO08mwDmHgtLsn_jqXU2G-YN2_zarpgTR7kDviwgNDsYjg8hicjM6REnwB3dOc41vXxAcYXX-jBG4Uxd2Q%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.usatoday.com) depending on which study you prefer. This means 14-25% of Americans have so much income that additional income doesn't increase their life satisfaction or happiness at all on average (for white males the percentage is even higher).

William MacAskill illustrates this concept in his book *Doing Good Better*:

> I call it the 100x Multiplier. For those of us living in rich countries, you should expect to be able to do at least one hundred times as much to benefit other people as you can to benefit yourself.
>
> -- Macaskill, Doing Good Better, p.23

This phenomenon is due to diminishing marginal returns: every additional dollar of income means less to you than the previous dollar, and eventually the dollars mean virtually nothing. This also means that an additional dollar to a poor person benefits them far more than an additional dollar to a rich person. Since incomes in the riches countries are about 100x higher than those in the poorest, and happiness scales roughly logarithmically with income (a doubling of income leads to the same amount of increased happiness whether you're poor or rich), we get the 100x multiplier. As your mother or father might say: there are starving kids in Africa that would love to have your leftovers.

Instead of consuming my leftover income, **I am pledging to give 10% of my income away to charity for the rest of my life** through MacAskill's [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) foundation. I plan to loosely follow the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) philosophy (more on this below), and donate the money to charities that are proven to be not only good, but the very best at preventing suffering.

As a rational being, I expect that this will have a net *positive* effect on my life satisfaction: if that income wasn't making me happier anyway, and now I get some utility out of feeling altruistic (or moral posturing), I should come out ahead. In that sense, and to get out ahead of the "white savior" critiques, this is a completely self-serving act. I am hesitant to share details of my finances and charitable giving with strangers online, but my hope is that by pledging this publicly I might be further committed to it or convince others to do this with me. If I convince just one other person, I've doubled my impact. Realistically however, very few people will visit my quiet corner of the internet and this pledge will be just for me.

## Effective Altruism

Effective Altruism gives a framework to start thinking about maximizing ones impact to the world. How many lives would you save as a doctor in a developing country? How many lives would you save by donating $50,000 per year to UNICEF? What is the smallest amount of money you could donate in order to save 1 life, or cure someone of a disability? These are obviously hard things to quantify, but using data and decision theory - which is what Effective Altruism does - is certainly better than guessing.

In my professional life, I do this every day. Businesses understand that maximizing the value of their work, and being able to demonstrate it using hard data, is a good thing to do. That's why I've spent the last 2 years of my career on randomized experimentation and value quantification: it pays off. Why then, should philanthropies be any different? In my opinion, it is no wonder people don't donate to charity as much as you'd expect them to given the diminishing returns to additional income in a rich society: they have no idea what they're buying!

Here's MacAskill again:

> imagine if you went into a grocery store and none of the products had prices on them. Instead, the storekeeper asks: "How much would you like to spend at this grocery store today?" When you give the storekeeper some money, he hands over a selection of groceries chosen by him.
>
> This, of course, would be absurd. If this was how things worked, how could we figure out if one grocery store was better than another? One store could charge ten times the amount for the same produce, and, prior to actually paying for the products, we wouldn't be able to tell.
>
> If it would be absurd to buy groceries this way, why is donating to charity any different? In the case of charity, you're buying things for other people rather than yourself, but if you're interested in using your money to help other people, that shouldn't make a difference.
>
> -- MacAskill, Doing Good Better, p. 33

The point is that we have lots of very useful and effective ways of doing business and we aren't applying them to charities. Effective Altruism aims to change that, among other things.

Some of the concepts of Effective Altruism include calculating expected values, thinking in terms of marginal (instead of average) gain, and considering counterfactuals, all in the name of making the best decisions in order to maximize "profit". This is literally exactly what I did at my last job, and when applied to business, all of these ideas make sense. We try to make the decisions that maximize the net marginal profit, and we do that by calculating the expected value of a decision against the counterfactual.

When acting altruistically, however, we get lazy. We donate to those who are most readily available in our minds, perhaps the folks we see and feel most personally attached to like the beggar outside your local coffee shop or the foundation your friend is involved with. I am guilty of this as well, and I am not trying to convince you that this behavior is "wrong." Rather, I'd like to point out that there is another way to use your money and time that might result in more net benefit to those you wish to help.

I am not an Effective Altruism purist, however. I recognize that there are plenty of arguments for giving to those you feel most personally attached to, especially your own children. In some sense you have an obligation to these people. While it's true that you could save dozens of lives by donating your child's college fund to buy Malaria Nets instead, I don't expect most people would ever even consider that, and for good reason.

On the other hand, I think we should consider "what is the opportunity cost of this altruistic act?" If I only have $10 to give to charity, and I want it to do the most good, how should I spend it? A foundation called [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) is a good place to start asking that question. At GiveWell, researchers try to understand which charities are most effective at directing your donations to help those in need.

I recognize, however, that it isn't a zero-sum game. Your compulsion to buy the homeless man a coffee this morning probably didn't reduce your propensity to make your annual donation to the local homeless shelter. In that sense, your cup of coffee was simply additional good. In fact, this behavior would not be at odds with Effective Altruism when applied properly.

Thus, think of Effective Altruism as one more thing to draw on to decide how to do the most good in the world. We all think about this question, and I'm thankful to have found a starting point for finding the answers.
