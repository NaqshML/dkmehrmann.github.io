## The Premise

One of the premises underlying Effective Altruism seems to be that all lives are created equal, and that we should prevent harm or death if possible. Most often, this is expressed in the form of lives saved, or years of health restored. This is partially because health outcomes are fairly easy to measure, and there are decent records worldwide of deaths. It also easily transfers across cultures: everybody everywhere lives, potentially gets sick, and dies.

Put generally, the objective is to maximize the overall utility: transferring $100 to a person in a developing country will give them more utility than you will lose by the action, therefore it is morally right.

Even backing off of this strong version of the premise, the weaker version is that if you can *prevent undue harm* to someone at relatively little cost, you ought to do it: If $100 can prevent your untimely death, but would allow me to upgrade the upholstery in my Acura, it's really hard to argue (at least emotionally) that one should opt for the leather seats.

I don't take much issue with this premise, however I'd like to argue that it has been selectively applied to those that already exist, and that we in the effective altruism community should address this contradiction. To be fair, I'm not a philosopher by trade, so I intend this post as an open inquiry; unfortunately I haven't yet figured out how to Google this question, and it has been nagging at me for weeks.

## The Problem

We make no distinction across extant humans about who deserves more or less, but we do make a distinction between already living and not-yet-born. Specifically, the premises of effective altruism more heavily weight those that already exist. In the cost-benefit analyses that effective altruists often cite, we take a look at which interventions prevent the most harm, often in the form of QALYs, or preventing death or death-equivalent.

But what about births? How would we weigh an intervention that caused births rather than prevented deaths? In order to make such a comparison, we'd have to understand what the resource cost of raising the human would be and compare it to the QALYs that they'd enjoy. By almost no comparison would it be *worth* the cost of raising the human, compared to the QALYs that would be saved if we donated the money to the most effective causes. In that sense, every birth causes more suffering than the person can make up for even if they live an incredible life.

But what would change if, hypothetically of course, we could control births, and only allow births when the marginal utility of that person existing outweighed the harm that could be prevented if they were never born and resources were reallocated to help those most in need? You can think of this as a utility equilibrium, wherein the worst-off person is equal to the average new person born. That could only happen if everybody was exactly the same, which would be the logical conclusion of utilitarianism, so this idea seems in line with utilitarian and therefore effective altruistic thinking.





It seems that in the framework of the Trolley problem, effective altruists would opt not to pull the lever even if it meant more deaths. That fact seems to run contrary to the utilitarianism that underpins effective altruism, and therefore - I believe - must be addressed.
