## Intro

We all know that money can't buy happiness, but we're also pretty bad at parting with it. Would it help you to know that after a certain level of income, your marginal utility of additional income flatlines? In fact, [Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton have put a number on it](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489): **$75,000**.

Of course this number is nothing but an anchor, or a starting point to think about how much income each of us would be happy with. In fact, if you expand your definition of happiness, you might get [a number closer to $105,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=JBgmiRAoYQhtBgbj0zSVX9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6pRUGAIioLhu85ORBsjF_g5Rf0fuUViMASagr_M7VEy5MRXaYGPiRKa_FSO3qh3qFZW2eGnWNkmHVW7J5KJM5kHZ_dY8AULUrukyysIQ5PxXS7cUPJ28GwywaXRvjNOW4O4S4YopfDke1c2jLpKYweA_UiNmDU37muQ3AVIlWIl62D0tBToG48TSKGKsGp9KMPce9WhaRHaEaoEzqc98rna7AGO08mwDmHgtLsn_jqXU2G-YN2_zarpgTR7kDviwgNDsYjg8hicjM6REnwB3dOc41vXxAcYXX-jBG4Uxd2Q%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.usatoday.com).

If you use the high estimate of $105,000, that percentage drops to 14%, still a large fraction of workers. This means 14-25% of Americans have so much income that additional income doesn't increase their life satisfaction or happiness.

I am fortunate enough to be in that group of Americans, and that is why **I am pledging to give any income over $75,000 for good**. I am hesitant to share details of my finances online, but my hope is that by pledging this publicly I might convince others to do this with me.

The details of what I consider "good" are currently under construction, so I'm not ready to declare them publicly just yet. I do however plan to loosely follow the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) philosophy (more on this below).

## Effective Altruism

Effective Altruism gives a framework to start thinking about maximizing ones impact to the world. How many lives would you save as a doctor in a developing country? How many lives would you save by donating $50,000 per year to UNICEF? What is the smallest amount of money you could donate in order to save 1 life, or cure someone of a disability? These are obviously hard things to quantify, but using data and decision theory - which is what Effective Altruism does - is certainly better than guessing.

In my professional life, I do this every day. Businesses understand that maximizing the value of their work, and being able to demonstrate it using hard data, is a good thing to do. That's why I've spent the last 2 years of my career on randomized experimentation and value quantification: it pays off. Why then, should philanthropies be any different? In my opinion, it is no wonder people don't donate to charity as much as you'd expect them to given the diminishing returns to additional income in a rich society: they have no idea what they're buying!

William MacAskill, in his wonderful book called [Doing Good Better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/), illustrates this point:

> imagine if you went into a grocery store and none of the products had prices on them. Instead, the storekeeper asks: "How much would you like to spend at this grocery store today?" When you give the storekeeper some money, he hands over a selection of groceries chosen by him.
>
> This, of course, would be absurd. If this was how things worked, how could we figure out if one grocery store was better than another? One store could charge ten times the amount for the same produce, and, prior to actually paying for the products, we wouldn't be able to tell.
>
> If it would be absurd to buy groceries this way, why is donating to charity any different? In the case of charity, you're buying things for other people rather than yourself, but if you're interested in using your money to help other people, that shouldn't make a difference.
>
> -- MacAskill, Doing Good Better, p. 33

The point is that we have lots of very useful and effective ways of doing business and we aren't applying them to charities. Effective Altruism, among other things, aims to change that.

Some of these concepts include calculating expected values, thinking in terms of marginal (instead of average) gain, and considering counterfactuals, all in the name of making the best decisions in order to maximize "profit". This is literally exactly what I did at my last job, and applied to business, all of these make sense. We try to make the decisions that maximize the net marginal profit, and we do that by calculating the expected value of a decision against the counterfactual.

When acting altruistically, however, we get lazy. We donate to those who are most readily available in our minds, perhaps the folks we see and feel most personally attached to like the beggar outside your local coffee shop or the foundation your friend is involved with. I am guilty of this as well, and I am not trying to convince you that that behavior is "wrong." Rather, I'd like to point out that there is another way to use your money and time that might result in more net benefit to those you wish to help.

I am not an effective altruism purist, however. I recognize that there are plenty of arguments for giving to those you feel most personally attached to, especially your own children or other family. In some sense you have an obligation to these people. While it's true that you could save dozens of lives by donating your child's college fund to buy Malaria Nets instead, I don't expect most people would ever even consider that, and for good reason.

On the other hand, I think we should consider "what is the opportunity cost of this altruistic act?" If I only have $10 to give to charity, and I want it to do the most good, how should I spend it? A foundation called [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) is a good place to start asking that question. At GiveWell, researchers try to understand which charities are most effective at directing your donations to help those in need.

I recognize, however, that it isn't a zero-sum game. Our compulsion to buy the homeless man a coffee this morning probably didn't reduce your propensity to make your annual donation to the local homeless shelter. In that sense, your cup of coffee was simply additional good. Thus, think of Effective Altruism as one more thing to draw on to decide how to do the most good in the world. We all think about this question, and I'm thankful to have found a starting point for finding the answers.
