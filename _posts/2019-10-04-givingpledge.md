## Intro

We all know that money can't buy happiness, but we're also pretty bad at parting with it. Would it help you to know that after a certain level of income, your marginal utility of additional income flatlines? In fact, [Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton have put a number on it](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489): **$75,000**.

Of course this number is nothing but an anchor, or a starting point to think about how much income each of us would be happy with. In fact, if you expand your definition of happiness, you might get [a number closer to $105,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=JBgmiRAoYQhtBgbj0zSVX9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6pRUGAIioLhu85ORBsjF_g5Rf0fuUViMASagr_M7VEy5MRXaYGPiRKa_FSO3qh3qFZW2eGnWNkmHVW7J5KJM5kHZ_dY8AULUrukyysIQ5PxXS7cUPJ28GwywaXRvjNOW4O4S4YopfDke1c2jLpKYweA_UiNmDU37muQ3AVIlWIl62D0tBToG48TSKGKsGp9KMPce9WhaRHaEaoEzqc98rna7AGO08mwDmHgtLsn_jqXU2G-YN2_zarpgTR7kDviwgNDsYjg8hicjM6REnwB3dOc41vXxAcYXX-jBG4Uxd2Q%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.usatoday.com).

> **25% of Americans employed full-time earn an income of $75,000 or more**

\- Source: [https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/](https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/)

If you use the high estimate of $105,000, that percentage drops to 14%, still a large fraction of workers. This means 14-25% of Americans have so much income that additional income doesn't increase their life satisfaction or happiness.

I am fortunate enough to be in that group of Americans, and that is why **I am pledging to give any income over $75,000 for good**. I am hesitant to share details of my finances online, but my hope is that by pledging this publicly I might convince others to do this with me.

## The Economics of Giving

I was inspired to do this by the ["real" Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/About.aspx) that several billionaires have taken to give away the majority of their wealth. A giving pledge can be thought of as a voluntary tax where, instead of giving money to the government to distribute how it sees fit, you get to choose yourself where the money goes. The most common argument against high taxes for the rich is that it will disincentivize working or otherwise contributing to the economy. The logic seems sound: if you impose higher taxes, working more results in less income than it did before, and therefore higher taxes will mean our most valuable members of the economy contribute to it less.

For at least the individuals that have taken the Giving Pledge, this does not seem to hold. Money past a certain point is more a method of keeping score, and mostly the game you're playing at that point is against yourself. Bezos doesn't want another billion so he can buy a bigger yacht, he wants another billion because that means his Amazon project is going well.

Even if you don't buy that, remember that a giving pledge is voluntary, meaning that you only take it if you're not motivated by consumption dollars in the first place. Critics might argue that somebody giving away their money will give them less political influence (we know [money does indeed buy politics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf)), and that they could do more good with political influence than transfers of wealth. My counterargument would be that nothing in the pledge is precluding you from using your giving dollars in politics, as long as your political agenda is to "do good", however you define it. If you want to donate to the libertarian candidate who's going to lower taxes on the wealthy because that's your vision of a "good" society, that's fine by me.

Proponents of the free market (especially those in the Libertarian camp) have long purported that private charity could replace government welfare. I'm skeptical of that notion, but I recognize how deeply capitalism is engrained in our society. Instead of upending the system that brought us great prosperity, I believe we need better mechanisms to use it for the benefit of all its participants, not just those at the very top.

I also believe there are lots of people with extra income that don't know what to do with it, and our society has made it extremely easy to consume but extremely difficult to give. We have the ability to change that.

As income inequality grows, this problem will only get worse. Higher education is extremely expensive, but for a small portion of graduates the investment pays off big time. The average Computer Science graduate from University of Illinois (my alma mater) [is pulling $100k,](https://cs.illinois.edu/about-us/statistics) while the person preparing their company-sponsored breakfast is fighting for 1/3 of that.

It takes hard work to graduate with a CS degree, but it also takes inborn intelligence, a good high school education, sound college advising, and a support system at home. Most Americans are lacking at least one of those by no fault of their own, and as one of the lucky ones I believe I owe it to those less fortunate to help out.

But I know I'm not alone in this belief. I know there are many people who know how much luck determined their economic outcome, and maybe feel guilty about it, and want to *do something* but have no idea what or how.

But there are lots of questions one should ask. How much can we really afford to give? How do we know we won't need the extra income in the future for medical bills or other tragic events? Which cause should I give to, and how do we know the money we give is actually going to help people? How can I do the most good? The concept of [Effective Altruism]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) helps to answers some (but not all) of these questions.

## Effective Altruism

Effective Altruism gives a framework to start thinking about maximizing ones impact to the world. How many lives would you save as a doctor in a developing country? How many lives would you save by donating $50,000 per year to UNICEF? What is the smallest amount of money you could donate in order to save 1 life, or cure someone of a disability? These are obviously hard things to quantify, but using data and decision theory - which is what Effective Altruism does - is certainly better than guessing.

In my professional life, I do this every day. Businesses understand that maximizing the value of their work, and being able to demonstrate it using hard data, is a good thing to do. That's why I've spent the last 2 years of my career on randomized experimentation and value quantification: it pays off. Why then, should philanthropies be any different? In my opinion, it is no wonder people don't donate to charity as much as you'd expect them to given the diminishing returns to additional income in a rich society: they have no idea what they're buying!

William MacAskill, in his wonderful book called [Doing Good Better](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/), illustrates this point:

> imagine if you went into a grocery store and none of the products had prices on them. Instead, the storekeeper asks: "How much would you like to spend at this grocery store today?" When you give the storekeeper some money, he hands over a selection of groceries chosen by him.
>
> This, of course, would be absurd. If this was how things worked, how could we figure out if one grocery store was better than another? One store could charge ten times the amount for the same produce, and, prior to actually paying for the products, we wouldn't be able to tell.
>
> If it would be absurd to buy groceries this way, why is donating to charity any different? In the case of charity, you're buying things for other people rather than yourself, but if you're interested in using your money to help other people, that shouldn't make a difference.
>
> -- MacAskill, Doing Good Better, p. 33

The point is that we have lots of very useful and effective ways of doing business and we aren't applying them to charities. Effective Altruism, among other things, aims to change that.

Some of these concepts include calculating expected values, thinking in terms of marginal (instead of average) gain, and considering counterfactuals, all in the name of making the best decisions in order to maximize "profit". This is literally exactly what I did at my last job, and applied to business, all of these make sense. We try to make the decisions that maximize the net marginal profit, and we do that by calculating the expected value of a decision against the counterfactual.

When acting altruistically, however, we get lazy. We donate to those who are most readily available in our minds, perhaps the folks we see and feel most personally attached to like the beggar outside your local coffee shop or the foundation your friend is involved with. I am guilty of this as well, and I am not trying to convince you that that behavior is "wrong." Rather, I'd like to point out that there is another way to use your money and time that might result in more net benefit to those you wish to help.

I am not an effective altruism purist, however. I recognize that there are plenty of arguments for giving to those you feel most personally attached to, especially your own children or other family. In some sense you have an obligation to these people. While it's true that you could save dozens of lives by donating your child's college fund to buy Malaria Nets instead, I don't expect most people would ever even consider that, and for good reason.

On the other hand, I think we should consider "what is the opportunity cost of this altruistic act?" If I only have $10 to give to charity, and I want it to do the most good, how should I spend it? A foundation called [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org) is a good place to start asking that question. At GiveWell, researchers try to understand which charities are most effective at directing your donations to help those in need.

I recognize, however, that it isn't a zero-sum game. Our compulsion to buy the homeless man a coffee this morning probably didn't reduce your propensity to make your annual donation to the local homeless shelter. In that sense, your cup of coffee was simply additional good. Thus, think of Effective Altruism as one more thing to draw on to decide how to do the most good in the world. We all think about this question, and I'm thankful to have found a starting point for finding the answers.
