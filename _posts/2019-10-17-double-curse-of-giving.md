If you're serious about charitable giving, you probably want other people to do it too. That's sort of the point of doing things like [pledging your money away publicly](/2019/09/24/givingpledge.html). But how can you do so without being accused of [virtue signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling)? How can you be so sure you're *not* virtue signalling?

This dilemma pops up in other places, too. Maybe you help somebody pick up the notepad they dropped in the hall (did they really need your help?), or buy the Prius [so everybody will know you care about the environment](http://freakonomics.com/2011/04/21/conspicuous-conservation-and-the-prius-effect/). Are you really trying to do good, or do you want to signal to people "hey, I'm a person who does good!"?

Similarly, there are two schools of thought on altruism: [empathy-altruism and social exchange altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy-altruism). Social exchange altruism argues that altruistic behavior takes place only when benefits to the helper outweigh the costs, in other words acting directly in their own self-interest. Empathy-altruism argues that sometimes people will in fact act out of empathic concern to help others. It's hard to tell if either of these are "selfless" in any true sense of the word, but my hot take is that there probably is no true selfless altruism (meaning some element of selfishness is necessary for an altruistic act to occur).

This means that critics who complain that charitable giving is selfishly motivated probably have a point. In fact, that's probably part of the reason movements like effective altruism aren't the norm: people have a desire to give in a manner that benefits *them* most, not how it benefits those in need most. That might mean getting an empathic dopamine rush from helping those that are in close proximity to them, or benefiting from the social boost that accompanies being a charitable-seeming person.

On the other hand, critics are also missing a key component: giving to charity is almost always a good thing for humanity. Yes, it would be better for those gifts to be directed to causes that are most effective while perhaps unglamorous, but let's not let the best be the enemy of the good. Perhaps those people wouldn't have donated at all if we considered selfish donations to be repugnant. Indeed, lowering the moral bar for a person to donate to charity might increase charitable giving overall. If even a selfish schmuck like me can be a donor, what's the harm in wearing it on my sleeve?
