This post should really be titled "The Problem with GDP and other aggregate measures of national output/income." I'm talking about those single numbers that tell us how well an economy is functioning. So wherever you see "GDP" in this article, feel free to replace with GNP or Net National Income or whatever flavor you like.

The premise of this argument is that an economy exists as a means to serve humanity rather than an end itself. The best economy is one that creates the most good for the most people. From this utilitarian perspective, we'd like to be able to measure something like net national utility, or net global utility, but utility is notoriously elusive to measure.

We can however employ some of the abstractions we've created to help us describe utility to better understand how to best describe how well an economy is functioning. What is the best measure of success for an economy, then? I argue here that it certainly isn't GDP, for two principle reasons.

## GDP doesn't care about distribution

If 100 people make 10 dollars, or 1 person makes 1000 dollars, these economies both have GDPs of 1000 dollars. If we accept the premise that there are diminishing marginal returns to consumption, and that income is only useful to generate more income or to consume (altruism notwithstanding), then there are diminishing marginal returns to income. With that in mind, there are income distributions that will generate different amounts of utility, even holding total output constant.

Under the law of diminishing returns, given a certain GDP, the utility maximizing income distribution is the one where everybody makes exactly the average income. This is not a policy suggestion; imposing strict egalitarianism will likely result in a collapse of GDP (and social order). But it stands to reason that, all else equal, narrower income distributions create more utility.

For example, if Norway and Sweden have the same GDP per capita, but Sweden has a narrower distribution, the law of diminishing returns suggests that Sweden will have a higher net utility, even though both countries score the same on the principal measure of how well an economy is functioning. Given an economy exists to generate the most utility for the most people, we could say that the GDP measure fails to account for this very important aspect of the functioning of the economy.

## GDP doesn't care about what's being produced

Say there's a kid in your neighborhood running around breaking windows every night. The neighborhood window-fixer (called a glazier, believe it or not) is doing big business. He hires the two unemployed teenagers on the block as junior glaziers just to keep up with demand. Everybody else's incomes continue to stay the same (say they are farmers), but the glazier-proprietor and his henchmen are making a lot more. Suffice to say neighborhood income goes up.

In another neighborhood, there is no neighborhood hooligan. The glazier is doing fine, but the farmer-citizens are doing a bit better (in terms of cash on hand) since they're not paying for window repairs all the time. They band together and buy a tractor, and with it they're able to farm more crop. Income goes up, food prices go down, everybody is happy. Suffice to say neighborhood income goes up.

What's going on here? How can both of these neighborhoods experience a spike in GDP when the second is clearly in a better situation? Maybe you've recognized this as the oft-cited broken window fallacy. It clearly matters what is being produced, and whether or not that good confers net benefit on society itself.

A more extreme example would be a country that collects exorbitant tax revenues to fire missiles into space. This action has no benefit, but there is a lot of economic activity required to produce the missiles, and therefore this action would be a boon to GDP.

## Conclusion

For many, these arguments aren't exactly original, and border on banality. Despite this, I see a lot of macroeconomic discussion centered around GDP, GNP, National Income, etc. I think these measures are useful, but we must constantly resist the temptation to simplify the functioning of something complicated and inherently moral to a single number. To do so is to miss the beauty of an economy.
