# Manifesto

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <h4>Abstract</h4>

  The short version is gonna go here

</div>


I like to start essays with quotes.

> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.
>
> -- Various sources


> What the hell is a manifesto doing on a Data Science website?
>
> -- You, Probably

So before we go any further, let's level set:

> **manifesto:** a published verbal declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or government
>
> -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto)

No, this isn't another [Time Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube). Sorry. This will be much less entertaining.

I was inspired by [an essay by Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/career-crisis/).
