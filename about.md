# About

My name is Andrew Mehrmann and I'm a data scientist living in Chicago. In my professional life I sit at the intersection of Data Science and engineering, creating tools and services to bridge the gap between data science and the "real world". These may include platforms for machine learning deployment, interactive applications for exploring data, or web services for delivering insights to customers. My mission is to enable data scientists do great work and see that work through to fruition. You can read more about me [below](#personal-statement).

## Personal Statement

I should mention up front that this is not a strictly professional website. I’ve tried to
separate things based on what I perceive the readers interest in me might be, but the
content may come as a surprise to some who come expecting to see your standard professional
portfolio. Who wants to read some unqualified opinion about the Economics of Information when
they’ve come to vet me for a Data Science job, anyway?

I find that writing, like teaching, is one of the best ways to understand something. The
Self is no exception. My greatest hope for this site is that by writing introspectively,
deeply, and honestly, I’ll help myself define and refine what my personal and professional
goals and motivations are.

With that said, I want to reiterate that I'm not writing here to gain the respect of
potential employers; this is not a long-form cover letter. This site is as much for me
to understand my own purpose, both in life and in career, as it is to proclaim that purpose
publicly.

I’ve found in most aspects of life honesty can actually save you a lot of trouble. The biggest
struggle with being dishonest is that you can only keep up the dishonesty for so long: it’s a
lot less work to be honest, especially to yourself.

I was especially moved by this (very honest) [blog post](https://yihui.name/en/2018/02/career-crisis/)
by Yihui Xie, an active and influential member of the R community. In his description of what
he calls a “career crisis," he touches on themes you don’t normally hear talked about in the professional
world like mental health, burnout, and self-discovery.

What we can learn from lessons like Yihui’s is that you can’t fit a square peg in a round hole. We,
as humans, don’t all respond to the same incentives. Not only that, but we sometimes don’t even know
what incentives we DO respond to, or we respond in the opposite direction that we expect ourselves to.

I think far too much focus is placed on objective measures of professional qualification. Does the
candidate have the necessary years of experience? Does she hold a degree from a prestigious University
in a relevant field of study? Does he list the Microsoft Office suite as one of his Skills?

Money, freedom, and power for example are all assumed to be good things that people should strive for.
Such statements are clearly over-generalized, yet our society still shepherds us toward such ends. If
you’re not careful, it’s easy to get swept up in the current.

The antidote to this, I think, is honesty. Honesty allows you and those around you to find what is right
for you without having to pretend to fall in line with what society wants of you. By letting employers,
significant others, and family members know who you really are, neither one of you needs to do the hard
work of putting up a facade.

This will inevitably get you turned down from jobs. The really prestigious, high-paying ones will sting
the most (remember, we’re hardwired to believe the herd). But it’s better to do the hard work up front
of finding something that’s right for you than pretending to be someone you’re not, just to find that you
really don’t care for the round hole you’ve found yourself leaning cockeyed out of.

Let me be clear: I have nothing against high-paying jobs, nor against the prestigious firms who pay out the
wazoo for top talent. What I do know is that the incentives for taking such jobs are often things that
don’t bring long-term, honest, real satisfaction. And it’s easy to substitute those often-quantifiable
incentives for happiness, success, or any other critically important yet ambiguously defined metric.

Our minds have been shown to invoke heuristics when faced with difficult questions. What’s more difficult
than deciding what to do or beleive? It follows that we should be at least a little suspect of deriving
quick answers to questions like “is this a good career move” or “what kind of person should I marry.”

Predictably, society has tried to answer these for us. The job should be stable and high-paying. The spouse
should have a good job and be attractive. We’ve all heard the cliches. Honesty, and I mean real, brutal,
keep-me-up-at-night self-honesty, means pushing past the instinct to skip the question and copy off our
neighbor. Here, in my case, it means not hiding the aspects of my psyche that aren’t deemed “marketable."

And such is the purpose of this blog: to explore honestly the things that pique my interest. The things
I write are pieces of me that I wish to share with you, the reader, for no other purpose than holding
myself to a higher standard of thought (and writing). I may never find that one thing that I’m truly
passionate about - such a thing may not even exist - but I hope that my explorations in pursuit of that
end will lead me down the right path.
