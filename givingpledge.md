## Intro

We all know that money can't buy happiness, but we're also pretty bad at parting with it. Would it help you to know that after a certain level of income, your marginal utility of additional income flatlines? In fact, [Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton have put a number on it](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489):

<center><h1>$75,000</h1></center>

Of course this number is nothing but an anchor, or a starting point to think about how much income each of us would be happy with. In fact, if you expand your definition of happiness, you might get [a number closer to $105,000](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0277-0.epdf?referrer_access_token=JBgmiRAoYQhtBgbj0zSVX9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P6pRUGAIioLhu85ORBsjF_g5Rf0fuUViMASagr_M7VEy5MRXaYGPiRKa_FSO3qh3qFZW2eGnWNkmHVW7J5KJM5kHZ_dY8AULUrukyysIQ5PxXS7cUPJ28GwywaXRvjNOW4O4S4YopfDke1c2jLpKYweA_UiNmDU37muQ3AVIlWIl62D0tBToG48TSKGKsGp9KMPce9WhaRHaEaoEzqc98rna7AGO08mwDmHgtLsn_jqXU2G-YN2_zarpgTR7kDviwgNDsYjg8hicjM6REnwB3dOc41vXxAcYXX-jBG4Uxd2Q%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.usatoday.com).

> **25% of Americans employed full-time earn an income of $75,000 or more**

If you use the high estimate of $105,000, that percentage drops to 14%, still a large fraction of workers. This means 14-25% of Americans have so much income that additional income doesn't increase their life satisfaction or happiness.

I am fortunate enough to be in that group of Americans, and that is why **I am pledging to give any income over $75,000 for good**. I am hesitant to share details of my finances online, but my hope is that by pledging this publicly I might convince others to do this with me.

## The Economics of Giving

I was inspired to do this by the ["real" Giving Pledge](https://givingpledge.org/About.aspx) that several billionaires have taken to give away the majority of their wealth.

A giving pledge can be thought of as a voluntary tax where you get to choose where the money goes. The most common argument against high taxes for the rich is that it will disincentivize them from contributing to the economy. The logic seems sound: if you impose higher taxes, working more results in less income than it did before, and therefore higher taxes will mean our most valuable members of the economy contribute to it less.

For at least the individuals that have taken the giving pledge, this does not seem to hold. Money past a certain point is more a method of keeping score, and mostly the game you're playing at that point is against yourself. Bezos doesn't want another billion so he can buy a bigger yacht, he wants another billion because that means his Amazon project is going well.

Even if you don't buy that, remember that a giving pledge is voluntary, meaning that you only take it if you're not motivated by consumption dollars in the first place. Critics might argue that somebody giving away their money will give them less political influence (we know [money does indeed buy politics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf)), and that they could do more good with political influence than transfers of wealth. My counterargument would be that nothing in the pledge is precluding you from using your giving dollars in politics, as long as your political agenda is to "do good", however you define it. If you want to donate to the libertarian candidate who's going to lower taxes on the wealthy because that's your vision of a good society, that's fine by me.
